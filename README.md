# Welcome to the Shortcut REST API Cookbook
The Shortcut REST API is a powerful tool that can make your work easier and enhance the ways that you use your Shortcut data.
We created this material to get you started using the Shortcut REST API to solve common requests, even if you don't regularly use APIs.

Maybe you need to get average Cycle time for the Epic you just completed, or you need to change the Label for incomplete work in a Sprint; this will show you how.

Some of these examples will guide you through using your command line to run the script. In other cases, we'll provide example code for specific tasks which will show you where to make small changes to interact with the data in your Shortcut account. You can also use this material as a starting place and make further adjustments for your particular needs.

Do you have an example you think we should cover? Please let us know! You can open an Issue on this repository so other teams can publicly add their interest, or email support@shortcut.com.

Found a typo or other small issue? Please feel free to submit a PR!

Questions and suggestions are welcome as Issues, or send us an email support@shortcut.com. We'd love to hear from you!
